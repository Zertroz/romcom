# RomCom  

### Abstract:
 We built a website that lets the user create random or form submitted romance novel covers. It can also save those covers to be viewed later, and allow the user to delete them. If the user really wants, they have plenty of romance novel covers at their disposal.

### Installation Instructions:
All the user needs to do is clone the repo or view the site from the github link.

### Preview of App:

### Context:
We worked on this project for about 2-3 hours a night for four nights, and then a whole 6 or so hours one day. As we're only on week 2 of the Turing program, we think this is a reasonable amount of time to have spent, especially considering there was a lot we just didn't understand.

### Contributors:
The work was split evenly between [Kass](https://github.com/Zertroz) and [Bea](https://github.com/bea-ordonez), with some help from others.

### Learning Goals:
We were primarily working with the DOM, using Javascript to alter an HTML document. We spent some time with a CSS file as well, but the majority of the focus was JavaScript. We also had to familiarize ourselves with the Git workflow, especially when it came to using branches.

### Wins + Challenges:
Win number one is getting the project done! It was very stressful and required a lot of work and thought. Our absolute win is probably getting iteration 2 done within only an hour or so. We really struggled with iteration 4, though, as it required using logic we weren't familiar with. We managed to overcome this with help from others and a little research of our own.
